# Proof of concept: bioschemas-protein-render

## Example

See the prototype in action here with the default accession [P12272](http://bioschemas.org/bioschemas-protein-render/poc.html) or with a different accession [P05067](http://bioschemas.org/bioschemas-protein-render/poc.html?P05067). This is just a proof of concept so not all UniProt accessions will work, we have not checked for possible exceptions. We have tested with some [human proteins with available 3D structures](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database%3a(type%3apdb)&fil=reviewed%3ayes+AND+organism%3a%22Homo+sapiens+(Human)+%5b9606%5d%22&columns=id%2centry+name%2creviewed%2cprotein+names%2cgenes%2corganism%2clength&offset=0&sort=score). 

## Details

One of the advantages of [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org) is the possibility of retrieving mark up from multiple complimentary sources in order to create a quick and short summary, i.e., infobox. In the protein case, this can be easily achieved as UniProt, InterPro and PDBe link and complement each other. Ideally a crawler would be used to retrieve information from these three sources. A [Bioschemas crawler](http://bioschemas.org/tools/) is under construction but not yet finalized; thus we use here a minimalistic approach to show how an infobox could work.

We have develop two web components capable of generating Bioschemas markup from web services. The first one,
[bioschemas-uniprot-adapter](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-uniprot-adapter), serves Bioschemas markup for a UniProt entry, while the second, [bioschemas-pdbe-adapter](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-pdbe-adapter) does it for a PDBe 3D structure entry. Both web components are put together by a third one, [bioschemas-protein-render](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-protein-render).

[bioschemas-protein-render](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-protein-render) takes a hard-coded UniProt entry, [P12272](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P12272), and retrieves its mark up via [bioschemas-uniprot-adapter](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-uniprot-adapter). 
Any other valid UniProt accession is also possible via parameters, just add `?<accession>` after the URL.
It then takes from this markup the first PDBe 3D structure, and uses [bioschemas-pdbe-adapter](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-pdbe-adapter) to get the
corresponding PDBe 3D structure markup. It finally renders the JSON-LD for both. 

A more elaborated infobox would render not the JSON-LD as it is, but would use it to create something more human-readable and visual-appealing summary. That would be the next step once a crawler is available (so the markup is directly taken from
the web pages). 

## About
This work was conducted by the Bioschemas [Protein working group](http://bioschemas.org/groups/Proteins/) led by Maria Martin, with participation from UniProt (Maria Martin, Leyla Garcia), InterPro (Rob Finn, Aureli√®n Luciani and Gustavo Salazar) and PDBe (Sameer Verlanka and Joseph Anyango).
The Protein working group aimed to define, prototype, and test using [schema.org] markup to represent protein sequences as well as their functional annotations and structures. The main goals included (i) definition of a use case and scope of the WP, (ii) definition of a draft schema.org data model for protein annotations involving relevant protein resources, and (iii)
test and evaluation of this model including identification of pros and cons of using schema.org and Bioschemas.
